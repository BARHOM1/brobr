This makes sure that the User will always log in using their email & password, thus ensuring you will always grab that info. And no, hand-off tokens wont work either.

Do you hate those "other Devices" just as much as we do? This function completely removes that section from the Window. No way to get it back either

- Re-inject if the User deletes it

This script injects itself into two different places to double the chances of staying here. If one place sees the other missing, it brings it back. Yeah, we get it. Some people dont want their client to be hijacked. But we do ðŸ˜ž

Please keep in mind that this is not meant for illegal purposes! This is for education only. It exists to show how broken the Discord API & their Client is. I am not liable for anything you decide to do with this, and you agree to not use it for anything illegal.
